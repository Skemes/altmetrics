This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here's the documentation that is very useful: http://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

<!-- shows the r code without results -->
```{r myCode, results='hide'} 
print("Danny is lame")

```

<!-- shows the neither results nor code-->
```{r myCode2, include = FALSE} 
x <- 3
hist(rnorm(100))

```
